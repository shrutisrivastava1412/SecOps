Decription : 
Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation via Uncontrolled Search Path / Binary Planting (also known as DLL hijacking).
Affected Versions: Notepad++ v8.8.1 and all prior versions.
Fixed Version: Notepad++ v8.8.2.
Severity: High (CVSS score of 7.3).
Impact: An attacker can gain SYSTEM-level privileges on a compromised system. This means they could potentially take complete control of your computer.
How it Works: The vulnerability lies in the Notepad++ installer. During installation, the installer looks for executable dependencies (like regsvr32.exe) in the current working directory without properly verifying them or using absolute paths. An attacker can exploit this by:
Crafting a malicious executable (e.g., named regsvr32.exe).
Tricking a user (e.g., through social engineering or clickjacking) into downloading both the legitimate Notepad++ installer and the malicious file into the same directory (commonly the "Downloads" folder).
When the user runs the legitimate Notepad++ installer, it unknowingly loads and executes the malicious regsvr32.exe from the same directory with SYSTEM privileges.

POC : 
1. Install Notepad++ <= 8.8.1 on victim machine
2. Crafting a malicious executable (e.g., named regsvr32.exe), reverse shell code to get system access to victim's machine.
3. Put the installer and the created file in one folder.
4. Start a listener on the attacker machine to connect with victim machine
4. When the installer is run , its finds the regsvr32.exe file in the same folder and executes it , giving a reverse shell with system access to victims machine , Notepad++ applictaion keeps running as usual.
5. Reverse shell code used : https://github.com/shrutisrivastava1412/Private/blob/main/Reverse%20shell%20code%20for%20-%20Notepad%2B%2B%20-%20CVE-2025-49144
